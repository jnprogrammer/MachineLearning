# MachineLearning

  

Start: 12/21/19

  

A repo dedicated to learning Machine Learning, Deep learning and AI so that I can combine this technology with Kubernetes to build a Machine learning network running with kubernetes.

  

I've bought 3 courses on Udemy

  

-   Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks
    
-   Artificial Intelligence A-Z™: Learn How To Build An AI
    
-   Artificial Intelligence: Reinforcement Learning in Python
    

  

I've also enrolled in a Coursera class

  

-   Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
    

  

This course is programming related because it teaches me how to read math as mathematicians do when explaining abstract concepts like The Upper Confidence Bounds which is expressed as Q(a)≤ˆQt(a)+ˆUt(a).

  

At the time of writing this readme I don’t understand how to read that function yet. I know the coding will be the easier part as once I have achieved understanding I will be able to create at will.

  

I will have a complete project done by

My Journey in Learning ML has lead me to a differnt Udemy course 

-   Tensorflow 2.0: Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence

The work I've jumped into has brought me to a point of understanding to what I need to focuse on, Statistics.

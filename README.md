# MachineLearning

Start: 12/21/19

A repo dedicated to learning Machine Learning, Deep learning and AI so that I can combind this technology with Kubernetes to build a Mechine learning network running with kubernetes. 

I've bought 3 courses on Udemy 

Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial Intelligence A-Z™: Learn How To Build An AI
Artificial Intelligence: Reinforcement Learning in Python

I've also enrolled in a Coursera class 

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking

This course is because I've learn that knowing how to think the way mathematicians do allows you to read algorithms better when it comes to machine learning. I've decided I will achive this level of depth in this topic. 

I will have a complete project done by

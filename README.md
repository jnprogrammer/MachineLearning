# MachineLearning

Start: 12/21/19

A repo dedicated to learning Machine Learning, Deep learning and AI so that I can combind this technology with Kubernetes to build a Mechine learning network running with kubernetes. 

I've bought 3 courses on Udemy 

Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial Intelligence A-Z™: Learn How To Build An AI
Artificial Intelligence: Reinforcement Learning in Python

I'll upload all material here.
